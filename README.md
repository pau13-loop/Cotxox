## Motivation

One of mybiggest motivations for this kata is the fact of be one of the first Katas i ever made in the Java language. It has helped me a lot to start build a good base in the OOP programming paradigm. I was really scared about how will be the transition of Python to Java but I've been surprised of how much it turn out it likes me Java, i could get a hint of how powerful this language could be implementing a good OOP programming paradigm.

## Reflections

It has been a really enjoyable kata, an easy level about the program to develop but what matters is not the result, in this kata what matters is the process you follow until you finish the kata, trying to apply correctly all the methodologies we have learned until now and step by step implemment them. I really enjoyed being meticulous in my process. I tried to apply correctly the SOLID Principles and i kept myself all time doing TDD programming to keep all my methods under control and try to avoid unnecesary mistakes. As well has been my first time trying to avoid block codes of nested if-elses trying to use streams, really usefull and one time you start to understand hoe they work will save you lot of time and unnecesary blocks of code that coul be avioded.

Completely recommendable Kata to anyone that is interested into the Java programming language, the OOP, SOLID Principles and TDD methodologies.
